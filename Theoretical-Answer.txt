Question 1:Â What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it is secure and reliable?

Ans. Creating and consuming secure and reliable APIs is crucial to protect data, ensure consistent performance, and maintain user trust. Here are the key considerations to keep in mind:

1. Input Validation and Sanitization
Validate all incoming data to ensure it meets the expected format, type, and constraints.
Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injections.

2. Error Handling and Logging
Provide meaningful and consistent error messages without exposing sensitive information.
Implement robust logging for monitoring and debugging purposes. Ensure logs are secure and do not contain sensitive data.

3. Data Encryption
Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using database encryption techniques).
Ensure API tokens and other credentials are stored securely, such as in environment variables or secure vaults.

4. Use API Gateways
API gateways provide a centralized entry point for API requests, offering features like rate limiting, logging, caching, load balancing, and security policies.

5. Detailed API Documentation
Provide clear and detailed API documentation, including security considerations, to help consumers use the API correctly and securely.

6. Input and Output Data Constraints
Enforce constraints on input data size and type to prevent payload-based attacks.
Ensure output data does not leak sensitive information and is formatted correctly.
7. Dependency Management Keep dependencies up to date and regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in libraries and frameworks used by the API.
8. Handling Sensitive Information
Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages or responses. Strip unnecessary data and ensure that error responses are generic.
9. Timeouts and Retry Logic
Implement timeouts for API requests to prevent hanging requests and ensure the API remains responsive.
Use retry logic for transient failures, but ensure that retries do not cause unintended side effects.
10. Scalability and Performance Optimization
Design your API to handle high loads by optimizing queries, using caching, and employing horizontal scaling techniques.
11. Secure API Endpoints
Secure endpoints with appropriate access controls and ensure that sensitive endpoints are not exposed unnecessarily.
By considering these key aspects, you can ensure your API is both secure and reliable, providing a robust foundation for developers and end-users alike.


Question 2: How will you tackle the challenge above?

To tackle the challenge of processing a CSV file with formulas and generating a processed output, follow these steps:

1. Parse the CSV File: Use Apache Commons CSV to read the input CSV file. Convert the CSV content into a format that can be easily manipulated by iterating through the records and processing each cell.

2. Process Formulas (if applicable): Implement logic to evaluate formulas within the cells. This involves parsing the formula, resolving cell references, and calculating the result. For now, the `processCell` method is a placeholder, so you'll need to add formula evaluation functionality here.

3. Generate Output CSV: After processing the data (including formula evaluation), convert the processed data back into CSV format. Use `ByteArrayOutputStream` and `PrintWriter` to write the data into a new CSV file.

4. Handle Errors: Ensure proper error handling throughout the process. This includes catching `IOException` during file operations and handling exceptions related to formula processing.

Question 3: What type of errors would you check for?

When processing CSV files, check for the following types of errors:

1. Malformed CSV File:
   - Improper Formatting: Handle cases where the CSV file is incorrectly formatted, such as missing commas or inconsistent row lengths.

2. Complex Formulas:
   - Unsupported Operations: Manage formulas with unsupported functions or syntax, which could lead to errors or incorrect results.

3. Missing References:
   - Undefined Cells: Check if formula references point to existing and valid cells to avoid calculation errors.

4. Data Type Mismatches:
   - Non-numeric Values: Ensure numeric operations handle non-numeric values gracefully to prevent errors.

5. Parsing Errors:
   - Incorrect CSV Formatting: Address issues related to unexpected delimiters or line breaks in the CSV file.

6. File Handling Errors:
   - Empty or Corrupted Files: Check for empty or corrupted files and ensure they can be read and processed correctly.

Question 4: How might a user break your code?

Here are some ways a user might break your code:

1. Malformed CSV File:
   - Improper Formatting: Uploading a CSV file with missing commas, inconsistent row lengths, or other formatting issues may cause parsing errors.

2. Complex Formulas:
   - Unsupported Operations: Using formulas with complex functions or syntax not supported by the current implementation could lead to calculation errors or crashes.

3. Missing References:
   - Undefined Cells: Formulas that reference non-existent or empty cells can result in calculation errors or exceptions.

4. Large Files:
   - Performance Issues: Very large CSV files may cause performance degradation or memory issues if not handled efficiently.

5. Non-Numeric Values in Numeric Operations:
   - Invalid Data: Including non-numeric values in cells where numeric operations are expected can lead to errors or unexpected results.
